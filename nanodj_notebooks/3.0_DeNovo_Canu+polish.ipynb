    "This notebook relies on [Canu](https://github.com/marbl/canu) to get a draft genome assembly, and in Nanopolish to improve the consensus sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Canu is a popular assembler based on the Celera Assembler that can reliably assemble complete microbial genomes and almost complete eukaryotic chromosomes. Canu has three stages: correction, trimming and assembly. Each of the stages can be executed independently or in series. More information of the process is available in the 2.0_DeNovo_Canu-Miniasm.ipynb notebook.\n",

    "[Nanpolish](https://github.com/jts/nanopolish) polishes the consensus sequence improving the accuracy of all assemblies. Nanopolish works with signal-level ONT data, the basecalled reads, and the draft assembly to generate an improved assembly. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first step is to get the draft assembly. Although this can be done with any assembly tool for ONT data, the following commands use Canu:"
