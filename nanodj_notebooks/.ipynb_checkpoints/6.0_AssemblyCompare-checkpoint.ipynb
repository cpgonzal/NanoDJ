    "## Comparing assemblies with QUAST\n",
    "\n",
    "The assembly algorithms use different heuristic approaches to reconstruct complete chromosomes, correct errors in the reads and try to solve the problem of the repetitive regions of the genome. This is a challenge when using methods that evaluate the quality of an assembly and compare the different assemblies.\n",
    "\n",
    "[QUAST](https://github.com/ablab/quast) (QUality ASsessment Tool) evaluates and compares genome assemblies and provides various important metrics. It builds comparisons between multiple assemblies of a given genome and can also add the reference genome to the comparison (when available) to extract additional metrics. The QUAST output consists on metrics and graphs that facilitate the interpretation of the assembly results. QUAST also provides metrics to describe structural errors in contigs, reports a list of fully/partially covered genes for each assembly, and presents a series of statistics in a graphic form. However, QUAST does not report scaffolding statistics. The user will need other software to assess this. QUAST also has a [web interface](http://quast.bioinf.spbau.ru/) for comparison of assemblies, with the option to compare against a reference. \n",
    "\n",
    "QUAST adds methods and quality metrics to evaluate the assembly from existing software (Plantagora, GAGE, GeneMark.hmm and GlimmerHMM) generating statistics such as the well-known N50 (minimum contig length to cover at least 50% of the genome) and introducing new statistics like the NA50 (is N50 where the length of aligned blocks is counted instead of the contig lengths). To align the assemblies with a reference genome and evaluate the metrics according to the alignments, QUAST uses the Nucmer aligner. \n",
    "\n",
    "The common output of an assembly tool, such as Canu or Flye, consists on a directory with intermediate files and a final assembly or contigs files in FASTA format. QUAST command can take several contigs files in FASTA for each assembly that the user wants to include in the comparison. The user can also include the genome reference and specify the name of the directory for the output. Using test assemblies computed in previous notebooks, the following provides an example of using QUAST from NanoDJ."
