    "###### NOTE: This notebook has high memory and computational requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "Obtaining the assembled sequence of a complete genome is a complex multi-step task. For De novo assembly, the simplest elements of the hierarchy are the reads provided after the sequencing. The next level of hierarchy is the alignment of multiple reads without definite order (i.e. contigs). Finally, the top level of the hierarchy corresponds to the sum of two or more contigs where a (near) complete structure of the genome under study is obtained. Ideally, one expects to obtain a single fragment (contig) for each chromosome or a plasmid that is present in the genome. However, most of the times the assemblies are incomplete, especially when dealing with short reads that can be caused by the process of preparing the material or by the technological limitations. Specifically, when a repeat region is longer than the reads, this will create a single contig in the assembly with multiple connections. ONT provide long reads that can solve this problem albeit the per-base quality is still low (approximately 12-15% error rate)."

    "## De novo Canu assembly pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook relies in the popular Canu pipeline (with Racon and Pilon to polish the assembly result) and Miniasm for de novo assembly of ONT reads. \n",
    "\n",
    "[Canu](https://github.com/marbl/canu) is a popular assembler based on the Celera Assembler that can reliably assemble complete microbial genomes and almost complete eukaryotic chromosomes. Canu has three stages: correction, trimming and assembly. Each stage can be executed independently or in series. Each of the three stages begins by identifying the overlaps between all the pairs of input reads, where they count k-mers in the reads, creating an indexed store of the overlays. From the input reads, the correction stage generates corrected reads. The trimming step trims non-compatible bases and detects fork adapters, chimeric sequences and other anomalies. The assembly stage builds an assembly graph and the contigs. Canu handles the repetitions probabilistically, by statistically filtering the repetitively induced overlays and retrospectively inspecting the graph for possible errors, thereby reducing the possibility of selecting a repetitive k-mer for the overlap. In this way, Canu performs multiple rounds of read and overlapping error correction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Canu substantially reduces coverage requirements with a low coverage hierarchical assembly. In this case, it is recommended to polish the assembly with short high-quality reads. Canu results are optimal with long-read coverages above 20x. \n",
    "\n",
    "Canu works with either FASTA or FASTQ files (compressed and uncompressed), but FASTQ format is needed to run some of the steps and complete the full pipeline. The help page is called with the \"canu -h\" command. These are the parameters needed for running Canu with our data:\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color='blue'>-p</font> and <font color='blue'>-d</font> : Assembly files prefix and output directory. Both parameters can be the same and output directory doesn't have to exist before execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color='blue'>genomeSize</font> : The estimated genome size. In our case, 2.1 mbp so we write '2.1m'. We can put letter g for gbp or k for kbp as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color='blue'>-nanopore-raw</font> : The path to our reads in FASTQ.\n",
    "\n",
    "Canu auto-detects available resources and will configure job sizes based on the resources and genome size that is being assembled. The following code uses advanced options like 'corMemory' and 'corThreads' to limit the resources in order to make Canu work on a resource-limited environment. These options also prevent Canu to stop the process because of a lack of computation power."

    "## De novo Miniasm assembly\n",
    " \n",
    "[Miniasm](https://github.com/lh3/miniasm)Â is a fast Overlap-Layout-Consensus-based option for de novo assembly of noisy long reads. Miniasm builds high-confidence contigs (unitigs) concatenating pieces of read sequences. It takes all read self-mappings as input to output an assembly graph. At least for high-coverage bacterial genomes, Miniasm can generate long contigs from raw ONT reads without error correction. The error rate of the assembly is the same as that of the raw input reads. In this way, Miniasm produces uncontaminated and uncorrected contig sequences from raw read overlays. To reduce the presence of artefacts such as adapters and untrimmed chimeras in the assembly, Miniasm calculates the per base coverage based on good mappings (longer than 2 kb with at least 100 bp non-redundant bases on matching minimizers) versus other reads. \n",
    "Furthermore, Miniasm ignores internal matches, eliminates contained reads, and adds overlays to the assembly graph. To avoid multiple edges, Miniasm uses the longest overlay. When the assembly graph is generated, it removes the transitive edges, trims the tilt units composed of few reads, and permits small bubbles to appear. \n",

    "Although it cannot produce a high-quality consensus, Miniasm is extremely fast and produces continuous and structurally accurate assemblies, at least for genomes without excessive repetitive sequences. \n",
